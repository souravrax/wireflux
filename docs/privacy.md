# Privacy Policy

This document explains how Wireflux handles data and privacy considerations.

## Data Collection

### What Wireflux Collects

**Wireflux CLI does NOT collect any personal data or telemetry.**

Specifically, Wireflux:

- ❌ Does not send usage analytics
- ❌ Does not collect personal information
- ❌ Does not track user behavior
- ❌ Does not send data to external services
- ❌ Does not create accounts or require registration

### What Wireflux Accesses

Wireflux only accesses data you explicitly provide:

1. **Configuration Files**: Reads your `wireflux.config.ts/js` file
2. **OpenAPI Schemas**: Reads OpenAPI specification files (local or remote URLs you specify)
3. **Output Directory**: Writes generated code to the directory you specify
4. **User Dependencies**: Imports your fetch client and error class files

## Data Processing

### Local Processing Only

All data processing happens locally on your machine:

- OpenAPI schema parsing
- Code generation
- File operations
- Configuration loading

### No External Transmission

Wireflux does not transmit any data externally, except:

- **Remote Schema Fetching**: If you provide a URL in the `input` field, Wireflux will make an HTTP request to fetch the OpenAPI schema
- **Package Installation**: Standard npm package installation process

## Generated Code Privacy

### Your Code, Your Data

Code generated by Wireflux:

- ✅ Belongs entirely to you
- ✅ Contains only what's in your OpenAPI schema
- ✅ Does not include any Wireflux-specific tracking
- ✅ Can be used in any application without privacy concerns

### No Hidden Dependencies

Generated code:

- Does not connect to Wireflux services
- Does not include telemetry or tracking
- Only depends on the fetch client and error class you provide

## Third-Party Services

### npm Package Registry

When you install Wireflux via npm:

- npm's privacy policy applies to the installation process
- No additional data sharing with Wireflux maintainers

### Remote OpenAPI Schemas

If you configure Wireflux to fetch OpenAPI schemas from remote URLs:

- HTTP requests are made directly from your machine to the specified URL
- Subject to the privacy policy of the service hosting the schema
- No proxy or intermediary services involved

### Dependencies

Wireflux uses the following runtime dependencies:

- `commander` - CLI framework (no data collection)
- `openapi-types` - TypeScript types (no data collection)
- `ts-node` - TypeScript execution (no data collection)

None of these dependencies collect telemetry or personal data.

## Documentation Website

### This Documentation Site

If you're reading this on our documentation website:

- Standard web server logs may be collected (IP addresses, user agents)
- No cookies or tracking scripts
- No personal information required or collected
- Hosted by standard web hosting services (subject to their privacy policies)

## Development & Contributing

### Contributing to Wireflux

When contributing to the project:

- Your GitHub profile information is visible (as per GitHub's privacy policy)
- Commit messages and code contributions are public
- No additional personal data is collected by the project

### Issue Reporting

When reporting issues:

- Only include information necessary to reproduce the issue
- Avoid including personal or sensitive data in issue reports
- GitHub's privacy policy applies to issue data

## Data Security

### Local Data Security

Since Wireflux operates entirely locally:

- Your data security depends on your local machine security
- No additional security measures needed for Wireflux-specific data

### Best Practices

We recommend:

1. **Secure Configuration**

   ```typescript
   // Use environment variables for sensitive URLs
   export default defineConfig({
     input: process.env.OPENAPI_URL || "./openapi.json",
     baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL,
   });
   ```

2. **Avoid Sensitive Data in Schemas**

   - Don't include API keys in OpenAPI schemas
   - Don't include internal URLs in public schemas
   - Use examples rather than real data

3. **Generated Code Review**
   - Review generated code before committing
   - Ensure no sensitive information is included
   - Use proper `.gitignore` for sensitive files

## Children's Privacy

Wireflux is a developer tool and is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

### Updates

We may update this privacy policy to reflect:

- Changes in data handling practices
- Legal requirements
- Community feedback

### Notification

Changes will be:

- Posted in this documentation
- Mentioned in release notes for significant changes
- Announced in project communications for major changes

## Your Rights

### Data Control

Since Wireflux doesn't collect personal data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, etc.) don't apply. However:

- You control all data processed by Wireflux (it's your data)
- You can delete generated code at any time
- You can stop using Wireflux without any data concerns

### Questions and Concerns

If you have privacy-related questions:

1. **Documentation**: Check this privacy policy and [FAQ](./faq.md)
2. **GitHub Issues**: Open an issue for privacy-related questions
3. **Email**: Contact maintainers (see [Contributing](./contributing.md))

## Legal Framework

### Compliance

This privacy policy is designed to be compliant with:

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Other applicable privacy laws

### Jurisdictions

As a global open source project:

- No specific legal jurisdiction for data processing (since no data is collected)
- Users subject to their local privacy laws
- Standard open source software usage applies

## Contact Information

**Summary**: Wireflux respects your privacy by not collecting any data. All processing happens locally on your machine, and generated code belongs entirely to you.
